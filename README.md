- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sudaxo, I'm very new into this, im practically the most fresh u can be on trhose stuff. Clueless, but curious, played around some with Ubuntu  & kali linux <for fun.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning all kinds off stuff. Watching alot of youtube videos, reading books from internet and more. But i guess my biggest interest is hacking, not to become a hacker, 
but to understand it to protect myself and community.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ~~~~
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing atm. I could take all help i can get, in with ppl think i should use, right now im on a Windows 10. Know VM machines abit. 2 not 1
